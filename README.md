#### **2. Phishing Indicators**  

| **Red Flag**                  | **Example from Email**                           | **Analysis**                                        |  
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
| **Suspicious Sender Address** | `ceo.webmail.1337@hotmail.com`                   | Free email domain (`Hotmail`) for CEO impersonation |  
| **Urgency & Pressure**        | "Just proceed with the wire transfer"            | Bypasses verification steps                         |  
| **Vague Justification**       | "Would have sent documents but am not available" | Avoids providing proof                              |  
| **Unprofessional Language**   | "Like i said earlier" (lowercase "I")            | Grammar errors uncommon in formal business emails   |  
| **Request for Secrecy**       | No CC to finance/legal teams                     | Isolates victim to prevent scrutiny                 |

#### **3. Header Analysis (Hypothetical)**  
*(Assuming full headers were extracted)*  
```  
From: ceo.webmail.1337@hotmail.com  
Return-Path: bulk.sender@phishing-network.com  
X-Originating-IP: 91.XXX.XXX.XXX (Nigeria)  
Authentication-Results:  
  - SPF: fail (Hotmail servers ≠ claimed sender)  
  - DKIM: missing  
```  
**Findings**:  
- IP geolocation mismatches the claimed CEO’s location.  
- No email authentication (SPF/DKIM) increases spoofing risk.  

---

#### **4. Social Engineering Tactics**  
1. **Authority Exploitation**: Pretends to be a CEO to intimidate the recipient.  
2. **Urgency**: Pressures quick action to prevent scrutiny.  
3. **Plausibility**: Targets employees with payment responsibilities (e.g., finance teams).  
4. **Avoidance of Checks**: Claims inability to provide documents.  

---

#### **5. Protective Actions**  
✅ **Do**:  
- Verify requests via secondary channel (e.g., phone call to known CEO number).  
- Implement multi-person approval for wire transfers.  
- Train staff to recognize CEO fraud tactics.  

❌ **Don't**:  
- Transfer funds without written/verbal confirmation.  
- Reply directly to the email.  
- Click any links (e.g., "beneficiary account details").

### **Interview Questions & Answers**  

#### **1. What is phishing?**  
Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (e.g., banks, companies) via email, SMS, or calls to steal sensitive data (passwords, credit card numbers) or deploy malware.  

#### **2. How to identify a phishing email?**  
- **Suspicious sender address** (e.g., `support@amaz0n.com` instead of `amazon.com`).  
- **Urgent/threatening language** ("Your account will be suspended!").  
- **Mismatched URLs** (hover over links to see actual destinations).  
- **Grammar/spelling errors** ("Dear Costumer").  
- **Unexpected attachments** (e.g., `.exe` files disguised as invoices).  

#### **3. What is email spoofing?**  
Forging the "From" field in an email to make it appear sent by a trusted source (e.g., impersonating a CEO’s email to authorize fraudulent transfers).  

#### **4. Why are phishing emails dangerous?**  
- **Data theft**: Credentials, financial info.  
- **Malware infections**: Ransomware, spyware.  
- **Financial loss**: Unauthorized transactions.  
- **Reputation damage**: Compromised accounts spread further attacks.  

#### **5. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?**  
- **Check email headers** for SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication.  
- **Verify domain ownership** via WHOIS lookup.  
- **Contact the sender** through a trusted channel (e.g., official website phone number).  

#### **6. What tools can analyze email headers?**  
- **Free online analyzers**:  
  - MXToolbox (https://mxtoolbox.com)  
  - Google Admin Toolbox (https://toolbox.googleapps.com)  
- **Email clients**: Outlook, Gmail’s "Show original" option.  

#### **7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?**  
- **Do not** click links/download attachments.  
- **Report** as phishing (use email client’s "Report Phishing" button).  
- **Delete** the email after reporting.  
- **Alert IT/security teams** if in a corporate environment.  

#### **8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?**  
- **Authority**: Impersonating CEOs/banks to intimidate victims.  
- **Urgency**: "Act now or lose access!" to bypass rational thinking.  
- **Familiarity**: Using personal details (e.g., "Hi [Your Name]") to seem legitimate.  
- **Scarcity**: "Limited-time offer" to trigger impulsive actions.
